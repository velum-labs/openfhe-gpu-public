Licensing
=========

The GPU implementation under ``src/core/lib/gpu`` includes files licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 (per headers). This is more restrictive than the BSD 2-Clause used by the rest of OpenFHE.

Implications
------------
- Non-commercial only; derivative works must share alike
- Incompatible with many commercial redistribution scenarios

Recommendation
--------------
If commercial use is required, seek relicensing/dual-licensing for the GPU code or reimplement kernels.
